/* 
Simple Definition of API
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a tool that allows two software applications or systems to communicate with each other.

It works like a messenger, sending requests from one system to another and returning the response.

Example:
When you use a food delivery app to track your order on a map, the app uses an API to get location data from services like Google Maps.

In short: API is the bridge that connects different software to share data and functionality.
